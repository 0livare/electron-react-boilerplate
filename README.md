# Electron with React Boilerplate

A minimal project setup for creating a react app inside of an electron app.

Much of this boilerplate is based off of [this wonderful tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/building-an-electron-application-with-create-react-app-97945861647c) on Free Code Camp. Additionally, scripts have been written in the `bld/` capable of creating an installer for the electron app.

## Scripts

**Run the app for development**: `yarn start`

**Build the React app for production**: `yarn build:react`

**Build an installer for the production React app**: `yarn installer`
